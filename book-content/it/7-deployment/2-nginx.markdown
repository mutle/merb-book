[Nginx](http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main) (pronounced "engine x") is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and [reverse proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy), as well as an IMAP/POP3 [proxy server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). Written by [Igor Sysoev](http://sysoev.ru/en/) in 2005, Nginx now hosts between 1% and 4% of all domains worldwide (sources: [1](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2007/06/web-server-software-and-malware.html), [2](http://survey.netcraft.com/Reports/200806/)). Although still in beta, Nginx is known for its stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.
