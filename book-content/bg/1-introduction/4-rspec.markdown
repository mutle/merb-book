## Introduction

[RSpec][] is a Behavior Driven Development framework for Ruby.
It provides two frameworks for writing and executing examples of how your Ruby 
application should behave[^rspec]:

 * a Scenario Framework[^cucumber] for describing behavior at the application level
 * a Code Example Framework for describing behavior at the object level
 
[RSpec][] was influenced by [Dan North][] and his Java-based BDD testing framework called [JBehave][].

## History

Initially BDD was just a discussion between [Aslak Hellesøy][] and [Dan North][]
in the [ThoughtWorks][] London office.
[Dave Astels][] joined the conversation with a blog post stating that he thought
these ideas could be easily implemented in [Smalltalk][] or [Ruby][].
[Steven Baker][] jumped in with an initial implementation, and released
RSpec 0.1. Later in 2006, maintenance was handed over to [David Chelimsky][].[^rspec-history]


## Behavior Driven Development 

Behavior Driven Development[^BDD] is an [Agile][] development process that comprises 
aspects of [Acceptance Test Driven Planning][], [Domain Driven Design][] and 
[Test Driven Development][].

> Behaviour-driven development is an “outside-in” methodology.
> It starts at the outside by identifying business outcomes, and then drills down
> into the feature set that will achieve those outcomes.
> Each feature is captured as a “story”, which defines the scope of the feature
> along with its acceptance criteria.
> - [Dan North][]{: .quote-author}

By focusing on the expected behaviors rather than the technical details,
developers can have a better communication with project owner and other stakeholders.

## Implementation

RSpec is a Domain Specific Language for describing the expected behavior 
of a system with executable examples.

Here is a very simple RSpec example.

    describe "Reader" do
      it "should have a browser" do
        reader = Reader.new
        reader.browser.should_not be_nil
      end
    end
