## Merb

Merb is the brainchild of [Ezra Zygmuntowicz](http://brainspl.at/).
The very first 'public' version of Merb appeared as a pastie on September 21st, 2006.
You can find this pastie [here](http://pastie.org/14416) or [here](http://gist.github.com/33252)
(mirror). Currently, the lead developer of the Merb project is [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/).

Starting with version 0.9 of the framework, all of the essential functionality was
put into 'merb-core', with the remaining extra functionality moved to other
components (such as merb-haml and merb-helpers). Version 1.0 was announced at
[RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org/) on November 7th, 2008.

The main source code repository is located on [Github](http://github.com/wycats/merb/).
