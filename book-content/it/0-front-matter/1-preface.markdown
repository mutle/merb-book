# Preface

Back when there was no Merb stack, no locked API, no organized documentation and the code base was changing often [Matthew Ford](http://github.com/deimos1986) decided to work on an open source book with a simple goal: help courageous Rubyists who wanted to live on the edge and decided to try Merb, DataMapper and RSpec.

Since then, Merb matured a lot, getting up and running became way easier and Merb decided to offer an **opinionated** version of the stack using Merb, DataMapper and RSpec! 

As an early Merb developer myself, I really enjoyed having access to Matt's book and I even contributed to the early version of the book. Since then, I joined the Merb team and with the rest of them, I focused on the big 1.0 release which we did successfully in two steps, the first Release Candidate during [MerbCamp 2008](http://merbcamp.com) and then 1.0 final during [RubyConf 2008](http://rubyconf.org).

Having a wonderful framework is great, but as Jason Seifer from [RailsEnvy.com](http://railsenvy.com) said to me after 1.0 was released:

> Merb has some awesome code documentation, the code is so easy to read, but the user documentation is still lacking.

Jason was right, our user documentation was not that great. Of course, we have the [wiki](http://wiki.merbivore.com) and a bunch of books available out there, but I have to say that looking at other frameworks such as [Django](http://www.djangobook.com/) the entire core team knew we had to do something.

Ford's efforts were noticed early on and he was offered a deal to write a [Merb book for Apress](http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430218234). As you can imagine, it became a bit hard for Matt to write a book for a publisher, have a full time job, contribute to various Open Source projects, keep up with Merb and finally make sure the open source book he started a while back would stay up to date. On top of that, many things changed pre 1.0 and a good part of the existing content needed a full rewrite.

That's why the Merb team decided it was time to get involved and to get the community focused on  a centralized, user oriented book.

I am really glad that the Merb team decided to take responsibility for this book and that we will make sure it stays well organized, up to date and relevant. However, this book, very much like Merb, won't grow and evolve much without the community help. So, please, send us corrections, new examples, new chapters so this book can help the community has a whole.
