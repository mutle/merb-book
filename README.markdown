# The Merb Open Source Book

This book is an open source book written for and by the Merb community.

Preview: <http://book.merbist.com>

To run the book locally,
just clone this repo and start the bundled copy of Merb:

		$ ./bin/merb
		
And open http://localhost:4000/ in your browser

Note that you might have to "redeploy" the native gems
if the <tt>merb</tt> app server doesn't start:

		$ ./bin/thor merb:gem:redeploy

A static HTML and a PDF version will soon be available online.

## How to contribute

 * Fork this project
 * Modify, fix, add content

For the moment, the content of the book
is located inside <tt>./book-content/</tt>
and is organized by languages, chapters, and pages.

Chapters and pages must be lowercase and start by a digit
followed by a dash and the chapter/page title
without spaces or any non ascii characters.

All content files are Markdown files;
the <tt>merb</tt> app uses [maruku][] to render these files.
Check the [supported syntax][]
or check ./book-content/en/1-introduction/1-ruby.markdown
for a good example of how to use images, quotes, and CSS selectors.

The book supports multiple languages.
Each language needs to replicate the English folder structure,
using the *same* file names.

If you are copying a page or chapter to your language folder
and want to mark a section of your text as requiring translation,
just add the <tt>to-translate</tt> class
to the CSS selector of your content, as shown below:

    {: .to-translate}

Please follow our editor guidelines, especially:

* use a language branch (so you can see what changed in the English content)
* one sentence per line (so merging is easier)
